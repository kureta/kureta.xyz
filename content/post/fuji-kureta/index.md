The first track, Introcello from the album Andrey, includes a Markov Chain percussion player based on Indian tabla rhythms. Markov Chain is a statistical model named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, hence the name of the album.

The track Kyrie, which is a sort of intermezzo of the album, is a reordering of the partials of Palestrina's Kyrie from Messa pro Defunctis.

Last track, Bohlen is a superposition of 12-tone equal temperament and the Bohlen-Pierce tuining system.

The album includes other ideas based on the spectrum of sound, statistical models applied on notes or spectra of audio signals, etc.
