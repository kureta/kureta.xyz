+++
Studied physics in Ankara University (2002-2006) and composition in Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul (2009-2013). I have been working with composers of the Istanbul Composer's Collective, including Emre Dundar, Mehmet Ali Uzunselvi, Sukret Gokay, and Mithatcan Ocal, for many years. Provided them with small pieces of software, OM patches, Max/MSP patches, Python scripts, etc. Also helped my colleagues as a recording, mixing, mastering engineer. I have also composed for Turkish television networks.

For the past 2 years I have been working on creative applications of Deep Learning in contemporary music, using Python, Tensorflow, and more recently Pytorch.
